## Features

- Network traffic analysis and monitoring
- Firmware security assessment
- Automated security checks
- Vulnerability documentation
- Remediation recommendations

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Wireshark
- tcpdump
- Network interface with monitor mode support
- Isolated test network environment

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure your test environment:
   - Set up an isolated network
   - Configure monitoring tools
   - Review and adjust settings in `config/lab_setup.md`

## Usage

1. Network Analysis:
```bash
python scripts/network_analyzer.py --device <device_ip>
```

2. Firmware Security Check:
```bash
python scripts/firmware_checker.py --firmware <firmware_file>
```

3. Security Scan:
```bash
python scripts/security_scanner.py --target <device_ip>
```
