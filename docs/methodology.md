# IoT Security Assessment Methodology

This document outlines the methodology used for assessing the security of IoT devices in this project.

## Testing Environment Setup

### Network Isolation
- Create a dedicated test network segment
- Use a separate router/access point for testing
- Implement network monitoring tools
- Document all network configurations

### Tools and Software
- Wireshark for network traffic analysis
- Nmap for port scanning and service enumeration
- Custom Python scripts for automated testing
- Firmware analysis tools

## Assessment Phases

### 1. Device Reconnaissance
- Document device specifications
- Identify manufacturer and model
- Research known vulnerabilities
- Document default configurations

### 2. Network Analysis
- Capture and analyze network traffic
- Identify communication protocols
- Check for encryption
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Document all findings

### 3. Firmware Analysis
- Extract firmware when possible
- Analyze firmware contents
- Check for hardcoded credentials
- Verify update mechanisms
- Document vulnerabilities

### 4. Physical Security
- Examine device casing
- Check for debug ports
- Assess tamper resistance
- Document physical vulnerabilities

## Testing Procedures

### Network Traffic Analysis
1. Connect device to test network
2. Start traffic capture
3. Perform normal device operations
4. Analyze captured traffic
5. Document findings

### Security Scanning
1. Run port scans
2. Check for open services
3. Test default credentials
4. Verify encryption
5. Document vulnerabilities

### Firmware Analysis
1. Obtain firmware
2. Calculate hashes
3. Check for signatures
4. Analyze contents
5. Document findings

## Risk Assessment

### Severity Levels
- Critical: Immediate action required
- High: Action required soon
